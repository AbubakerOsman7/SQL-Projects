## Student Assessment Database (SQL Programming):
- **Application Description:**<br>
Students are enrolled in subjects. Each subject has several courseworks that must be done by  students and for which they will gain marks. Each such coursework has a maximum possible numeric  mark: for example one subject may have two courseworks each marked out of 10 and one larger one  marked out of 30, whilst another may have 4 courseworks each marked out of 15. Each subject will  also have an exam and a resit. When a student takes an exam it is necessary to record whether they  are taking it for the first time or as a resit. Exams have several questions each with a maximum  possible mark. Exams may be set by more than one lecturer. Needless to say the individual lecturers  may have quite different ways of apportioning the marks between differing numbers of questions.  Questions may be marked by a different staff member than the question author. The database must be  able to store all such indicated information, across a number of semesters and academic years.

- **Part A — Design:**
  - Draw a Conceptual Schema (ER Diagram).
  - Translate the Conceptual Schema into a Relational Schema.
  - Normalise the Relations.<br>
  
- **Part B — Implementation:**
  - Implement this Schema using SQL in Oracle.
  - Populate the Database with Sample Test Data, making sure your Queries will work under any condition.
  - Create 5 View definitions and write 10 Queries of varying complexity, that can be frequently used (Canned Queries).
  
_**Tools**: Oracle, Visual Paradigm and SQL._
